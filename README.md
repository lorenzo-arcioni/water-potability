# Water potability
In this data science project, the goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the potability of water samples. The potability of water refers to its suitability for consumption and can be affected by various chemical and physical factors.

#### Pre trained model
In the models directory there are pre-trained model to use inside the Jupyter notebook. 
You have just to load them in the cells with fast load and test label!

#### Conda virtual environment
To ensure the lean execution of the notebook, i've insert a conda environment yml to use.
